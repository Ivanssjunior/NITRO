   Infinite For Loops
    
    A Infinite For Loop run indefinititely, when the condition in for statement is true whenever it is evaluated.

    As the condition is never going to be false, the control never comes out of the loop and forms an Infinite Loop,
    The condition will have a Inicialization going thru a condition and it will be verified if it's true,
    After the being validated whith a true condition it will go thru the statements, and there we're are,
    When the Statements are true the loop just keep updating, and it will never stops until the condition be false.
